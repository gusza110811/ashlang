# Advanced Shell programming Language
#### The simple programming language

A simple and minimal programming language, simple enough syntax to be used like a shell,
but practical enough to be used as a general-purpose language.

Designed to be usable in multiple context, whether it'd be CLI or GUI, Online or Offline.
Easy to learn, simple to use.

### A Code Sample
Print circumference of a circle with radius 5
```
radius = 5;
diameter = radius.mul(2);
circumference = diameter.mul(pi);
print(circumference);
```
<sub>Language Spec not finalized, syntax may change!</sub>

Both the the [standard interpreter](https://github.com/gusza110811/ASH) and this website are in development
